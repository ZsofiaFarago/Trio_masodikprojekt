                    <h4>THE ATHLEAN-X CREATOR JEFF CAVALIERE</h4>
                    Jeff Cavaliere is a fitness guru, social media star, personal trainer, and previous head physical therapist of the New York Mets ( professional baseball team).
                    He became fascinated with bodybuilding after seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger and action movie stars as a child. As a result, he chose to study physioneurobiology and physical therapy at college – in order to pursue a career in the fitness industry.
                    Since then, Jeff has become one of the most recognizable online fitness sensations – known for the training system he developed after leaving his position with the New York Mets.
